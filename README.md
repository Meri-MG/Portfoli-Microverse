If you are interested in setting up this repository locally in your machine, I suggest you to follow next steps:

Choose the repository and fork it to your Github account. It will create a copy of this repository. Choose a folder in your local machine where you want this repository to be copied. Afterwards open the terminal in your machine and get ready to clone repository. Make sure you direct your machine to the folder which you created for the repository. Run the clone command Make sure to attach link to the command that is generated in your forked repository and not in the main one. It should look similar to this git clone https://github.com/smithj/azure-docs.git Enter your github credentials if prompted. The clone command runs and downloads a copy of forked repository in your machine locally. Now You can explore the folder, see structure, check the code and write any changes if you want.
